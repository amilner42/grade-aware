# Introduction

Welcome. This is an angular 2 typescript client. Let's get started.

##### IDE

I develop mostly on Webstorm 11, which is a Jetbrains IDE, and has typescript
and angular 2 support. I recommend you do the same.

##### Install Instructions (Linux):

npm install -g ts-node

npm install

##### Useful Commands:

| Command       | Effect        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| npm start      | Compile all your scss and ts, will break if linter finds anything, will watch files once done. |
| npm run build.prod | Build all your code and put it in dist/prod |

# Configuration

Default application server configuration

```javascript
var PORT             = 5555;
var LIVE_RELOAD_PORT = 4002;
var DOCS_PORT        = 4003;
var APP_BASE         = '/';
```

Configure at runtime

```bash
npm start -- --port 8080 --reload-port 4000 --base /my-app/
```

# Running tests

```bash
npm test

# Debug - In two different shell windows
npm run build.test.watch      # 1st window
npm run karma.start           # 2nd window

# code coverage (istanbul)
# auto-generated at the end of `npm test`
# view coverage report:
npm run serve.coverage

# e2e (aka. end-to-end, integration) - In three different shell windows
# Make sure you don't have a global instance of Protractor

# npm run webdriver-update <- You will need to run this the first time
npm run webdriver-start
npm run serve.e2e
npm run e2e

# e2e live mode - Protractor interactive mode
# Instead of last command above, you can use:
npm run e2e.live
```
